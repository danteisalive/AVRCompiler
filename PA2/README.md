All the examples in the PA2Examples directory are working.
for testing all of them at once you can run regress.sh in PA2Examples directory
it will check the output of my compiler with the reference compiler

All the features are implemented including Arrays and MeggySetAuxLEDs and length

I added two new example to the examples in the PA2Examples directory:
1) ArrayExp.java   (includes arrays)
2) PA6rainbow.java   (includes arrays)
3) PA7GameOfLife.java  (icludes MeggySetAuxLEDs and length)
